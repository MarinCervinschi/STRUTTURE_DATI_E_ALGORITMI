This README.md provides an overview of the course "Data Structures and Algorithms" by Maurizio Vincini and Federico Bolelli, who teach at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (UniMoRe). It covers fundamental concepts such as activation records, recursion, complexity analysis, and various algorithms including backtracking, greedy, searching, and sorting. Additionally, it explores abstract data types such as lists, stacks, queues, and binary trees, along with their storage mechanisms.
